NULL(4) 		   Linux Programmer's Manual		       NULL(4)



NAME
       null, zero - data sink

DESCRIPTION
       Data written to the /dev/null and /dev/zero special files is discarded.

       Reads  from  /dev/null always return end of file (i.e., read(2) returns
       0), whereas reads from /dev/zero always return  bytes  containing  zero
       ('\0' characters).

       These devices are typically created by:

	   mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
	   mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
	   chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero

FILES
       /dev/null
       /dev/zero

NOTES
       If these devices are not writable and readable for all users, many pro-
       grams will act strangely.

       Since Linux 2.6.31, reads from /dev/zero are interruptible by  signals.
       (This  change  was made to help with bad latencies for large reads from
       /dev/zero.)
