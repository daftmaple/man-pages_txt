NAME
       wcscspn - search a wide-character string for any of a set of wide char-
       acters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcscspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t *reject);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcscspn() function is the wide-character equivalent	of  the  strc-
       spn(3)  function.  It determines the length of the longest initial seg-
       ment of wcs which consists entirely of wide-characters  not  listed  in
       reject.	 In  other  words, it searches for the first occurrence in the
       wide-character string wcs of any of the characters in the  wide-charac-
       ter string reject.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcscspn()  function  returns  the number of wide characters in the
       longest initial segment of wcs which consists entirely of  wide-charac-
       ters  not listed in reject.  In other words, it returns the position of
       the first occurrence in the wide-character string wcs  of  any  of  the
       characters in the wide-character string reject, or wcslen(wcs) if there
       is none.
