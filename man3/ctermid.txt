       ctermid - get controlling terminal name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       char *ctermid(char *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

DESCRIPTION
       ctermid()  returns  a string which is the pathname for the current con-
       trolling terminal for this process.  If s is NULL, a static  buffer  is
       used,  otherwise  s  points to a buffer used to hold the terminal path-
       name.  The symbolic constant L_ctermid is the maximum number of charac-
       ters in the returned pathname.

RETURN VALUE
       The pointer to the pathname.

BUGS
       The returned pathname may not uniquely identify the controlling	termi-
       nal; it may, for example, be /dev/tty.

       It is not assured that the program can open the terminal.
