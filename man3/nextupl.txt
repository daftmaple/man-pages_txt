NAME
       nextup,	nextupf, nextupl, nextdown, nextdownf, nextdownl - return next
       floating-point number toward positive/negative infinity

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE     /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <math.h>

       double nextup(double x);
       float nextupf(float x);
       long double nextupl(long double x);

       double nextdown(double x);
       float nextdownf(float x);
       long double nextdownl(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       The nextup(), nextupf(), and nextupl() functions return the next repre-
       sentable floating-point number greater than x.

       If x is the smallest representable negative number in the corresponding
       type, these functions return -0.  If x is 0, the returned value is  the
       smallest representable positive number of the corresponding type.

       If x is positive infinity, the returned value is positive infinity.  If
       x is negative infinity, the returned value is the largest representable
       finite negative number of the corresponding type.

       If x is Nan, the returned value is NaN.

       The value returned by nextdown(x) is -nextup(-x), and similarly for the
       other types.

RETURN VALUE
       See DESCRIPTION.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.24.
