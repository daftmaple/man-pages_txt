FPUTWC(3)		   Linux Programmer's Manual		     FPUTWC(3)



NAME
       fputwc, putwc - write a wide character to a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t fputwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);
       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fputc(3)
       function.  It  writes  the  wide  character  wc	to  stream.   If  fer-
       ror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character conver-
       sion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and  returns	WEOF.	Other-
       wise, it returns wc.

       The  putwc()  function  or macro functions identically to fputwc().  It
       may be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more  than
       once.  There is no reason ever to use it.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fputwc() function returns wc if no error occurred, or WEOF to indi-
       cate an error.  In the event of an error, errno is set to indicate  the
       cause.

ERRORS
       Apart from the usual ones, there is

       EILSEQ Conversion of wc to the stream's encoding fails.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The  behavior  of fputwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur-
       rent locale.

       In the absence of additional information passed to the  fopen(3)  call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fputwc() will actually write the multi-
       byte sequence corresponding to the wide character wc.
