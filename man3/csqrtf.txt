NAME
       csqrt, csqrtf, csqrtl - complex square root

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex csqrt(double complex z);
       float complex csqrtf(float complex z);
       long double complex csqrtl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  calculate the complex square root of z, with a branch
       cut along the negative real axis.   (That  means  that  csqrt(-1+eps*I)
       will be close to I while csqrt(-1-eps*I) will be close to -I, if eps is
       a small positive real number.)

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
