NAME
       iswspace - test for whitespace wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswspace(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswspace()	function  is the wide-character equivalent of the iss-
       pace(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to
       the wide-character class "space".

       The  wide-character  class  "space" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "graph" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses  "alnum",
       "alpha", "upper", "lower", "digit", "xdigit", "punct".

       The  wide-character  class  "space"  contains  the wide-character class
       "blank".

       The wide-character class "space" always contains  at  least  the  space
       character and the control characters '\f', '\n', '\r', '\t', '\v'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswspace()	function  returns  nonzero  if	wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "space".  Otherwise,  it  returns
       zero.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswspace() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur-
       rent locale.
