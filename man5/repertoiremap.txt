NAME
       repertoiremap - map symbolic character names to Unicode code points

DESCRIPTION
       A  repertoire  map  defines  mappings  between symbolic character names
       (mnemonics) and Unicode	code  points  when  compiling  a  locale  with
       localedef(1).   Using  a  repertoire map is optional, it is needed only
       when symbolic names are used instead  of  now  preferred  Unicode  code
       points.

   Syntax
       The  repertoiremap  file  starts  with a header that may consist of the
       following keywords:

       comment_char
	      is followed by a character that will  be	used  as  the  comment
	      character  for  the rest of the file.  It defaults to the number
	      sign (#).

       escape_char
	      is followed by a character that should be  used  as  the	escape
	      character  for  the  rest  of  the  file to mark characters that
	      should be interpreted in a special  way.	 It  defaults  to  the
	      backslash (\).

       The  mapping  section starts with the keyword CHARIDS in the first col-
       umn.

       The mapping lines have the following form:

       <symbolic-name> <code-point> comment
	      This defines exactly one mapping, comment being optional.

       The mapping section ends with the string END CHARIDS.

FILES
       /usr/share/i18n/repertoiremaps
	      Usual default repertoire map path.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.2.

NOTES
       Repertoire maps are deprecated in favor of Unicode code points.

EXAMPLE
       A mnemonic for the Euro sign can be defined as follows:

       <Eu> <U20AC> EURO SIGN
