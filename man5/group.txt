GROUP(5)		   Linux Programmer's Manual		      GROUP(5)



NAME
       group - user group file

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/group file is a text file that defines the groups on the sys-
       tem.  There is one entry per line, with the following format:

	   group_name:password:GID:user_list

       The fields are as follows:

       group_name  the name of the group.

       password    the (encrypted) group password.  If this field is empty, no
		   password is needed.

       GID	   the numeric group ID.

       user_list   a  list  of	the  usernames that are members of this group,
		   separated by commas.

FILES
       /etc/group

BUGS
       As the 4.2BSD initgroups(3)  man  page  says:  no  one  seems  to  keep
       /etc/group up-to-date.
